# What this repo is

This repo has some examples using multi-threaded-programming because someone
asked about how it works.

# Disclaimer

The examples have only been built/tested on Linux.

# Example 1

Just a very simple program that spawns a separate thread, prints some text, and
joins and stops.

# Example 2

Kind of overkill to implement a simple raytracer, but I needed something that
would take time to render and would benefit from multiple threads. This example
renders a scene with three lights and some spheres.
